In the past, using CFX Keymaster made it impossible to build CI/CD pipelines for
Escrow Resources due to the Cloudflare Bot Challenge.

However, CFX has now created a new platform called **"Portal"**, which is still
secured via Cloudflare but operates in a less restrictive attack mode, enabling
its use within a GitHub Action.

## How to Use It

To use this action, you need to authenticate via the forum using a cookie until
CFX provides API keys for this action.

1. Go to the **CFX Forum** and inspect the site using your browser's developer
   tools.
1. Navigate to the **Cookies** section and search for `_t`.
1. Copy the value of this cookie and save it in GitHub Secrets as
   `FORUM_COOKIE`.
1. Use the action in your workflow (remember to
   [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) before!):

   ```yaml
   - name: Upload Escrow Resource
     uses: Tynopia/cfx-portal-upload
     with:
       cookie: ${{ secrets.FORUM_COOKIE }}
       assetName: 'my_asset'
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When you log out of the forum, the cookie will become invalid, causing the
> action to fail. After configuring the secret, you should clear the cookie from
> your browser and log in again to avoid potential issues.

## Skip Upload

If you haven't uploaded an asset in a long time, the cookie will become invalid
due to inactivity. To prevent this, you can use a cron job to log in to the
portal and refresh the cookie.

```yaml
name: Refresh Cookie

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  refresh_cookie:
    name: Login to Portal
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run CFX Portal Upload
        uses: Tynopia/cfx-portal-upload@main
        with:
          cookie: ${{ secrets.FORUM_COOKIE }}
          skipUpload: true
```
